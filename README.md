LYRICS:
Verse 1:
🎵 "Hey there, buddy, got a rumble in your belly?
Don’t you worry, we’ll fix it nice and jelly!
Come on down where the fish are all smiles,
And the fries are golden, stacked in piles!" 🎵

Chorus:
🎵 "Fish and chips, get your fix,
One big bite, it's pure bliss!
Hook, line, sinker—oh, what a dish,
Come on down, it’s the fish you wish!" 🎵

Verse 2:
🎵 "Crunchy on the outside, tender in the middle,
Dip it in the sauce, you’ll solve that riddle!
From the fryer to your plate, it’s all hot,
Our fish and chips hit the perfect spot!" 🎵

Chorus:
🎵 "Fish and chips, get your fix,
One big bite, it's pure bliss!
Hook, line, sinker—oh, what a dish,
Come on down, it’s the fish you wish!" 🎵

Bridge:
🎵 "Swim on over, don’t think twice,
Our fishy friends taste oh-so-nice!
Fries that fly, fish that’s fried,
Welcome to the flavor ride!" 🎵

Outro:
🎵 "Fish and chips, get your fix,
Where every bite is deliciously slick!
Grab your crew, let’s make a wish,
At the spot where we serve up the dish!" 🎵
